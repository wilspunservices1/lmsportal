            User Policy Regarding Age
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our services are intended only for individuals who have reached the
            age of majority in their respective province of residence. We do not
            knowingly collect or request personal information from individuals
            under the age of 13 through the Site. If we become aware that we
            have unintentionally gathered personal data from a child under 13,
            we will take immediate steps to delete that information.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            For individuals between the ages of 13 and 18, we strongly recommend
            obtaining parental consent before using the Site or sharing any
            personal details online.

            Information Collection and Confidentiality
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            MEQMP collects both &quotpersonal information&quot and &quotpseudonymized
            information&quot from users. Pseudonymized information refers to data
            that cannot be directly linked to an individual without additional
            details—examples include gender, age, or nationality. In contrast,
            personal information is any data that can be directly associated
            with a specific person or entity, such as a name, email address,
            government-issued photo ID, biometric data, or webcam-captured
            images of the user and their surroundings.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Visitors can browse the Site without providing personal information.
            However, certain features, such as account login or product
            purchases, require users to submit personal details. This may
            include, but is not limited to, name, email address, phone number,
            postal address, company affiliation, job title, or industry.
            Additionally, our online contact form contains a &quotmessage&quot field
            where users may voluntarily provide further personal information.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            MEQMP may combine the personal information collected through the
            Site with other data obtained from third-party sources or previous
            interactions, such as email communications, phone conversations, or
            customer service records. Any such combined data will be treated as
            personal information and safeguarded in accordance with this Policy.

            When you use the Site, we automatically collect information such as
            your IP address, browser details, pages visited, download activity,

            logs or third-party tools for this purpose, including for online
            advertising.

            We may share your personal or pseudonymized information with third
            parties to fulfill requests, complete transactions, or comply with

            protecting our rights. In the event of a business transfer, your
            information will be subject to this Privacy Policy or a new one,
            with your consent.
